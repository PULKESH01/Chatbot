## Simple Chatbot with TensorFlow

This repository implements a basic chatbot using TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning framework by Google. The chatbot leverages a neural network to understand user input and classify it into predefined intents. Based on the detected intent, the chatbot provides an appropriate response.

### Functionality

* User enters text input.
* Chatbot classifies the input using a trained neural network.
* The chatbot retrieves a response based on the identified intent.
* The chatbot delivers the chosen response to the user.

### Data

The chatbot relies on a JSON file named `intents.json` to define its functionalities. This file structures the conversation by specifying:

* **Intents:** Categories representing user goals or questions (e.g., greetings, weather inquiries).
* **Patterns:** Examples of user phrases that fall under each intent.
* **Responses:** Predefined messages the chatbot delivers for each intent.

### Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries:

* TensorFlow
* Nltk
* numpy

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install nltk
pip install numpy
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Modify the `intents.json` file to customize intents, patterns, and responses.
3. Train the neural network model (specific instructions might be included in separate scripts).
4. Run the chatbot script to start interacting with your creation.

**Note:** Training instructions and specific execution commands might be provided in separate scripts within the repository.
